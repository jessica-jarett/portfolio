        "body": "<p>Risk Management Solutions Group was my first experience using Symfony at Bankers Healthcare Group. Prior to this project, our team was using the Laravel framework, which still used Controllers and Twig. This made the move to Symfony less of a learning curve and allowed me to focus on the front-end of this project more than the organization and setup of the new framework.</p><p>I had approximately 2 weeks to get the website developed, while not having a final design at the time I put pen to paper. I handled this scenario by starting my development mid-fidelity. I didn’t theme the project or add any images until they were provided. The site was various shades of gray and the font’s weren’t even finalized, but the structure and layout was there.</p><p>As the imagery, brand, and content was approved and delivered to me, I was already done with a lot of the brunt of the project. I was able to focus on those nit-picky items as they came to me. I was not going to miss the deadline by doing what I could ahead of time.</p><p>The website was one of the first to use a shared NPM package I wrote with shared mixins, variables and, most specifically, form styles that I used on the contact form. All I had to do was install the package using yarn, import the main.scss file in the project’s main file, call the form theme mixin, and all the styles were applied to our SDK’s generated forms.</p>"

        "body": "<p>Careers at BHG was a really fun project for me to work on, because I knew going into the project the importance of it; this website would be the first impression of many new employees at the company.</p><p>There were a lot of moving pieces to this project. The different buckets/areas of the site were managed by different business areas, so I was working with both the Marketing team and the HR team at the company, and getting feedback from all of them. This website was also the first one where I was solely responsible for the front-end and the deliverable dates.</p><p>This site was not templated and each page posed its own unique styles and challenges at every breakpoint. The colorful grids that you see are actually built with flexbox, and they restructure and restack at every breakpoint: small, medium, large, xlarge, and xxlarge. It was a lot, but the design called for it!</p><p>I utilized server-side rendering, Google’s job schema for Google Jobs, and Open Graph tags on our job posting pages to ensure our postings could be found and shared by anyone looking for them on any platform.</p><p>The website went live in the fall of 2020. As a result of the website, prospective employees can submit contact forms directly to HR at Bankers Healthcare Group, and the job listings are displayed on our own domain, rather than linking to the third-party site we use for applications and talent acquisition.</p>"
